To Run this program you will first need to intialize your mysql server through the xampp using the same method we have been using all semester. Once you have this intialized you'll need to run the included .sql file to set up your database for the program.

Since you've already made it this far, you have already downloaded and extracted the source materials folder. Now all that needs to be done is the following:

Open up the 'batFiles' folder and drag them into the directory that this document is located in.

Run two instaces of command prompt. In both of prompts navigate to the folder that this document is located in.

In one of the windows, type in "server.bat". Once the server gui pops up, click "Listen".

Now in the other window type in "client.bat". Once that pops up you will be able to create an account if you don't have one or login if you do. 

Upon a successful login, a simple Game Panel will be loaded for the client. However, we were not able to get client/server communication completed for our game so there is no functionality to this panel.

To test the game please run the 'runGame.bat' file. You can do this through a command prompt window as described for the other .bat files, or you can double click it.
Note: both player ships are receiving input from the same keyboard so their movements are synchronized.
